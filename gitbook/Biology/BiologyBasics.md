The task force related the competencies to three different types of individuals requiring bioinformatics training: 
* 1) bioinformatics engineers, who create novel computational methods needed by bioinformatics users and scientists; 
* 2) bioinformatics scientists, who employ computational methods to advance the scientific understanding of living systems; 
* 3) bioinformatics users, who access data resources and bioinformatics tools to perform duties in specific application domains (e.g., medicine, law, agriculture, food science, education, etc.).
